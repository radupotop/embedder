Embedder
========

A small JavaScript video embedder. It can embed almost any video according to rules.

For now it supports:
* Youtube videos and playlists
* Vimeo videos
* Soundcloud tracks and playlists
* TED videos
* Kickstarter videos

To skip embedding a certain video add `#noembed` at the end of the URL.

To run just download the script and include it in your page.
